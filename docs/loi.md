## Capstone Letter of Intent (LOI)

### I. Project Overview

- Capstone Project Name/Idea: Kinspace - Social platform for on-chain communities

- Brief Project Description: Kinspace is a Solana-based social platform designed to empower the creation and management of membership-based communities. Focusing initially on membership and NFT badges reward system, Kinspace provides a streamlined and on-chain solution for groups of any size – from local developer circles to online interest groups – to establish a verifiable and engaging presence within the Solana ecosystem.

- Reason for Choosing this Project: I want to create Kinspace to provide small communities with an accessible platform that simplifies the adoption of Web3 technologies. A lot of people start their Web3 journey from joining small niche groups, by combining community-driven engagement with blockchain-powered rewards, I want to empower these groups to connect, contribute, and build a stronger, more engaged ecosystem.

### II. Go-to-Market Strategy

#### Target Audience:

- Users: Individuals who are interested in forming a space for their communities or looking for one.

#### Value Proposition:

- For Users: better membership management, increased activity participation with rewards, build onchain presence.

#### Marketing and Distribution:

- Social media campaigns (engaging with relevant communities on Twitter, Telegram, etc.)

- Content marketing (creating blog posts, articles, and whitepapers about decentralized communities)

- Participation in industry events and conferences

#### Competitive Landscape: There are existing decentralized communities platforms, but Kinspace differentiates itself through:

- Accessible for small and close-knit communities, from local developer circles to online interest groups.

- Offer simpler decentralized governance and reward systems.

### III. Technical Details
